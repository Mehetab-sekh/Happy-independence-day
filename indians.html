    <td>Chandrashekhar Azad was one of the greatest minds of Indian Independence Movement. He was the mentor of many freedom fighters&#160;including Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru. Chandrashekhar Azad was originally Chandrasekhar Tiwari. He was also known as Chandrasekhar Azad or Chandra Shekhar. He was involved in several incidents including Kakori train robbery, assembly bomb incident, shooting of Saunders at Lahore, and to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai.He was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabra, Madhya Pradesh, and was the son of Pandit Sitaram Tiwari and Jagrani Devi. At Bhavra he received his early education and for higher studies, he went to Sanskrit Pathshala, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. He got involved in revolutionary activities at a very young age. Mahatma Gandhi that time launched a Non-Cooperation movement and he joined it. He got his first punishment at an age of 15 years when he was caught by the Britishers and sentenced to 15 whiplashes. Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919) deeply disappointed Chandrashekhar Azad. Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation movement in 1921 and Chandrashekhar Azad participated actively in it. But due to the Chauri-Chaura incident, Gandhi Ji suspended the Non-Cooperation movement in February 1922 that came as a blow to the Nationalist Sentiments of Azad. He then decided Hindustan Republican Association out of a sense of patriotism and took part in several national interest activities including Kakori train robbery, assembly bomb incident, shooting of Saunders at Lahore, and to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai.He wanted complete independence for India in any which way. He was betrayed by one of his associates and was besieged by the British police. On 27 February 1931, he arranged a meeting with revolutionaries at Allahabad's Alfred Park He fought with bravery but seeing no other way to escape, he shot himself and fulfilled his pledge of not being caught alive.To commemorate the bravery of Chandrashekhar Azad, after independence, Alfred Park in Allahabad was renamed as Chandrashekhar Azad Park. He lived only for 25 years but his role played in India's independence is not forgettable and inspired several Indians to take part in India's freedom struggle.

He was an Indian political leader, merchant, scholar and writer who was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom House of Commons between 1892 and 1895 and the first Asian to be a British MP, other than the Anglo-Indian MP David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, who was disenfranchised for corruption after nine months in office. Naoroji is renowned for his work in the Indian National Congress, of which he was one of the founding members and thrice — in 1886, 1893, and 1906 — elected president. Dadabhai Naoroji is regarded as one of the most important Indians during the birth of the nascent independence movement. In his writings, he came to the conclusion that the exertion of foreign rule over India was not favourable for the nation, and that independence (or at the very least, responsible government) would be the better path for India.
